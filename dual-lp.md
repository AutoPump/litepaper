#### Liquidity Strategy: Solid Foundations for AutoPump

**Dual Exchange Mechanism:**\
AutoPump will be available on not one, but two exchanges. This isnâ€™t just for show. By spreading out, we ensure more stability and better access for everyone, everywhere.

**Liquidity Provision Plan:**\
Weâ€™re dedicating a big chunk of our resources (80% from the pre-sale funds, to be exact) to make sure AutoPump has a strong and steady presence on these exchanges. This means whenever you want to buy or sell AutoPump, you can do so smoothly without big price jumps.

**Why This Matters:**\
Having AutoPump on two exchanges is key for something called arbitrage. This is when traders use price differences between places to make a profit. While they do this, they help us too. How? By increasing trading volume and making AutoPump's market more active and attractive.

**Our Commitment:**\
This dual-exchange approach and our focus on liquidity aren't just strategies. They're our promise to you for a reliable and dynamic trading environment. It's all about building confidence and growing together. With solid liquidity, we're all set for the journey ahead.
