# ðŸ¤‘ Tokenomics

**Initial Token Supply:**\
**1,000,000,000,000** **AUTO token.**

**Fee Structure & Allocation:**\
Hereâ€™s how it breaks down. Every transaction boosts the ecosystem:

* **AutoPump (3%):** This fee goes straight to our buyback-and-burn strategy, keeping the tokenâ€™s value on an upward trajectory.
* **Burn (5%):** Each transaction also sends a chunk of tokens to the great void, reducing supply and enhancing scarcity.
* **Liquidity (2%):** Weâ€™re ensuring the market stays liquid and healthy. Smooth sailing for all traders.

**Evolution of Fees:**\
Initially, the development fee kicks off our growth spurt, powering up marketing and new features. Once we hit that sweet spot of hype, we plan to cut the development fee to 0% and hand over the reins to the community by renouncing ownership.

**Potential Staking Feature:**\
There's a thought, link the development fee to a staking contract. Stack your AUTO and earn a piece of the action. Weâ€™re all about sharing the gains.

Remember, we're doing this together, shaping AutoPumpâ€™s future as a squad. Stay tuned as we navigate the thrilling crypto space. Onwards and upwards!
