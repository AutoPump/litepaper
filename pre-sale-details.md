#### Note:

* **All pre-sale funds will be added to liquidity on both DEXs.**
* **The launch will occur once the pre-sale goal is met**, aiming for a smooth transition to market trading.
* **Release Schedule**: The release schedule is specifically designed to protect our early investors, ensuring stability and long-term value for those who support us from the beginning.
* **Presale and Listing Price**: The price for the presale and initial listing on DEXs will be the same. However, due to potential bot activity, it might be challenging for all investors to purchase at the exact listing price. Thus, the listing price should act as a support level.
* **Market Cap at Listing**: We aim for a market cap of approximately **$100,000** at the time of listing, based on the total supply and the ETH raised during the presale. This valuation underscores our commitment to a stable and promising market entry for $AUTO.
