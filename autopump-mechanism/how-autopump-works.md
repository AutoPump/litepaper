# ⚙️ How AutoPump Works (Simplified)

**Understanding AutoPump: Advanced Yet Accessible**

AutoPump works by smartly managing its funds through what we call Range-Bound Liquidity (RBL). This means we adjust how much money is in the market, whether prices are going up or down. It's like having an autopilot for the token's price, making sure it doesn’t swing too wildly.

In technical speak, the AutoPump's action is defined by Δy = y - lim k/(100+ Δx) where Δx tends to be very large. Simply, it's a formula that helps us decide when to add or remove money from the market to keep the token's price steady.

All the money that makes this possible comes from the community—every bit of it is owned by the people who hold the token. Our rules make sure there's always enough money in the market to have stable prices.

Here's how the cycle works:

* **Fee Collection:** Each trade chips in a little to the AutoPump fund.
* **AutoPump Fund:** This is like a savings account for the token's future, only used to make the token more valuable.
* **Trigger Point:** When the fund hits the target number, AutoPump starts automatically.
* **Buyback and Burn:** We use the saved money to buy back tokens and destroy them, which means fewer tokens around and higher value for the ones that remain.

So, what we have with AutoPump is a self-driving system for maintaining the token's value. It's built to work on its own, adjusting to market changes to keep growing steadily. Think of AutoPump as your financial co-pilot in the crypto world, always working to get the best value for your tokens.
